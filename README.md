 - 🇩🇰 I live in beautiful København, Danmark.
 - 👨🏻‍✈️ Over a decade of experience in mentoring, leading successful teams and large projects.
 - ✨ Building user-centric products and architecting for long-term maintainability.
 - 🤖 I find joy in building highly-scalable distributed systems through robust architecture and fault-tolerance.
 - 🦊 In my free time I play with my Corgi, read old Sci-Fi, watch anime, play co-op games and learn Elixir.
 - 🫀 _From VR games, high-availability Microservices, leading department of 35 engineers - to high-traffic Enterprise websites, a CE-approved SaaS for cardiologists with ML-assisted tools they dreamed of, to robust data infrastructure as a service._
  
## I code, teach, write and explore.

I do my best to make enaging content that tickles people’s minds. I’m always open to challenging the mainstream and working on making amazing ideas a reality. 😊
